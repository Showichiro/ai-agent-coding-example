# User Authentication Feature

## Overview
This feature enables user registration and login functionality with email/password authentication and JWT-based session management. Users must be authenticated to access task management operations.

## Feature Purpose
- Allow users to register new accounts with email and password
- Enable secure login with credential verification
- Manage user sessions using JWT tokens
- Restrict task operations to authenticated users only

## User Stories

### Registration
**As a new user**, I want to register with my email and password so that I can access the todo application.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User provides valid email address and password
- Email must be unique in the system
- Password must meet security requirements (minimum 6 characters)
- Successful registration creates a new user account
- User receives confirmation of successful registration

### Login
**As a registered user**, I want to login with my credentials so that I can access my tasks.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User provides email and password
- System verifies credentials against stored user data
- Successful login generates and returns a JWT token
- Failed login shows appropriate error message
- JWT token contains user identification information

### Session Management
**As an authenticated user**, I want my session to be maintained securely so that I don't need to login repeatedly.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- JWT token is included in API requests for authentication
- Token has appropriate expiration time
- Invalid or expired tokens are rejected
- User can logout to invalidate their session

## Input/Output Behavior

### Registration Endpoint
**Input:**
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "securepassword"
}
```

**Output (Success):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "User registered successfully",
  "user": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "email": "user@example.com"
  }
}
```

**Output (Error):**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Email already exists"
}
```

### Login Endpoint
**Input:**
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "securepassword"
}
```

**Output (Success):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "token": "jwt.token.here",
  "user": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "email": "user@example.com"
  }
}
```

**Output (Error):**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Invalid credentials"
}
```

## API Endpoints

### POST /api/auth/register
- Registers a new user account
- Validates email format and uniqueness
- Hashes password before storage
- Returns user information on success

### POST /api/auth/login
- Authenticates user credentials
- Returns JWT token on successful login
- Token expires after configured duration

### POST /api/auth/logout
- Invalidates current user session
- Clears authentication token

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- JWT library for token generation and verification
- Password hashing library (bcrypt or similar)
- Email validation utilities
- Database access for user storage

### Feature Dependencies
- User model must be defined before implementation
- Database schema for user table required
- Authentication middleware for protecting task endpoints

## Security Considerations

### Password Security
- Passwords must be hashed using secure algorithms
- Minimum password length requirements
- Salt should be used for password hashing

### Token Security
- JWT tokens should have reasonable expiration times
- Tokens should be signed with secure secret keys
- Implement proper token validation middleware

### Input Validation
- Email format validation required
- Password strength validation
- Sanitize all user inputs

## Edge Cases

### Registration Edge Cases
- Duplicate email registration attempts
- Invalid email format provided
- Password too short or weak
- Database connection failures during registration

### Login Edge Cases
- Non-existent user attempts login
- Correct email with wrong password
- Account locked due to multiple failed attempts
- Token generation failures

### Session Edge Cases
- Expired token usage attempts
- Malformed token headers
- Token tampering detection
- Concurrent sessions from same user

## Error Messages

| Scenario | Error Message |
|----------|---------------|
| Email already exists | "An account with this email already exists" |
| Invalid email format | "Please provide a valid email address" |
| Password too short | "Password must be at least 6 characters long" |
| Invalid credentials | "Invalid email or password" |
| Token expired | "Session expired, please login again" |
| Missing token | "Authentication required" |

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- Password hashing and verification
- JWT token generation and validation
- Email format validation
- User registration logic
- Login authentication logic

### Integration Tests
- Registration API endpoint
- Login API endpoint
- Protected route access with valid token
- Protected route rejection with invalid token
- Database user creation and retrieval

### End-to-End Tests
- Complete user registration flow
- Complete user login flow
- Task access after authentication
- Session expiration handling
