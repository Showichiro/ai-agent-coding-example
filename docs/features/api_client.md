# API Client Feature Specification

## Requirements Traceability

This feature specification maps to the following requirements from `docs/requirements/base.md`:

- **Section 1 (ユーザー認証)**: Lines 11-14 - User authentication with JWT session management
- **Section 2 (タスク管理)**: Lines 16-28 - Task CRUD operations requiring API communication
- **Section 3 (フィルタ・ソート機能)**: Lines 30-32 - Task filtering and sorting operations
- **Non-functional Requirements**: Lines 38-40 - Next.js App Router backend integration

## Overview

The API Client feature provides a centralized, type-safe communication layer between the frontend application and the Next.js API routes. This feature enables secure, authenticated API requests for user authentication and task management operations.

## Purpose

To establish a robust, secure, and developer-friendly interface for frontend-backend communication that:
1. Handles authentication token management automatically
2. Provides type-safe API request/response handling
3. Implements consistent error handling across all API operations
4. Supports both user authentication and task management workflows

## Feature Scope

### Core Functionality

#### Authentication Operations
- User login with email/password (maps to `user_authentication.md`)
- User registration with email/password (maps to `user_authentication.md`)
- Session validation and token refresh (supports JWT session management requirement)
- Automatic token storage and retrieval
- Logout functionality with token cleanup

#### Task Management Operations
- Create new tasks (maps to `task_management.md` creation)
- Retrieve task list with sorting options (maps to `filter_sort.md`)
- Update existing tasks (maps to `task_management.md` editing)
- Delete tasks (maps to `task_management.md` deletion)
- Batch operations for multiple tasks

#### Technical Features
- Automatic authentication header injection
- Request/response type safety using existing API types
- Comprehensive error handling with specific error types
- Configurable timeout and retry mechanisms
- Development-friendly debugging capabilities

### Input/Output Behavior

#### Authentication Flow
```
Input: { email: string, password: string }
Process: POST /api/auth/login with credentials
Output: { user: User, token: string } | AuthError
Side Effect: Store authentication token for subsequent requests
```

#### Task Operations Flow
```
Input: CreateTaskRequest | UpdateTaskRequest | string (for ID)
Process: Authenticated API calls to /api/tasks endpoints
Output: Task | Task[] | DeleteResponse | ValidationError
Side Effect: Update application state with API responses
```

#### Error Handling Flow
```
Input: Any API operation
Process: Detect error type (network, auth, validation, server)
Output: Typed error with user-friendly message
Side Effect: Trigger appropriate UI error handling
```

## Integration Points

### Frontend Integration
- React components import API client for data operations
- Custom hooks wrap API calls for component state management
- Context providers manage authentication state globally
- Form submissions trigger API client methods

### Backend Integration
- API client calls Next.js App Router API routes
- Endpoints defined in `app/api/tasks/` and `app/api/auth/`
- Request/response formats match backend API specifications
- Authentication tokens validated by backend middleware

### Feature Dependencies
- **Depends on**: `user_authentication.md` for auth endpoints
- **Depends on**: `task_management.md` for task CRUD endpoints
- **Depends on**: API types from backend implementation
- **Supports**: All frontend UI components requiring data operations

## User Stories

### Story 1: Authenticated API Requests
**As a** frontend developer  
**I want** automatic authentication header management  
**So that** I don't have to manually handle tokens for each API request

### Story 2: Type-Safe API Calls
**As a** developer  
**I want** TypeScript support for all API operations  
**So that** I can catch type errors at compile time

### Story 3: Centralized Error Handling
**As a** developer  
**I want** consistent error handling across all API calls  
**So that** users receive appropriate feedback for different error scenarios

### Story 4: Simple API Interface
**As a** frontend developer  
**I want** a simple, intuitive API for common operations  
**So that** I can focus on UI logic rather than API integration complexity

## Edge Cases and Constraints

### Authentication Edge Cases
- Token expiration during active session
- Network connectivity loss during authentication
- Invalid credentials handling
- Session timeout scenarios

### API Request Edge Cases
- Network timeouts during task operations
- Server errors (5xx responses)
- Validation errors (400 responses)
- Concurrent request conflicts

### Technical Constraints
- Must work in both browser and Node.js environments
- Token storage must be secure and persistent
- API calls must be cancellable for component unmounting
- Error messages must be user-friendly and actionable

## Success Criteria

1. **Authentication Integration**: Seamlessly handles login/logout flows with token management
2. **Task Operations**: Successfully performs all CRUD operations defined in `task_management.md`
3. **Error Resilience**: Gracefully handles and reports all error scenarios
4. **Type Safety**: Provides full TypeScript support with no `any` types
5. **Developer Experience**: Simple API that reduces boilerplate code in components
6. **Performance**: Efficient request handling with appropriate caching strategies

## Implementation Requirements

### Required Exports
- `ApiClient` class for advanced configuration
- `api` singleton instance for common usage
- Error types: `ApiError`, `NetworkError`, `TimeoutError`
- Helper functions: `handleApiError`, type guards
- React integration utilities (hooks, context providers)

### Configuration Options
- Base URL configuration for different environments
- Timeout settings for different operation types
- Custom headers for debugging and versioning
- Authentication callbacks for token refresh and logout

### Security Requirements
- Secure token storage (localStorage with fallback)
- Automatic token cleanup on logout
- HTTPS enforcement for production
- Request/response logging for debugging (development only)

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- API client instantiation and configuration
- Authentication token management
- Error handling for different scenarios
- Type safety validation

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end authentication flows
- Task CRUD operations with real API endpoints
- Error scenario testing with mock responses
- React component integration testing
