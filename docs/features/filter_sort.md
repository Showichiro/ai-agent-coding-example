# Filter and Sort Feature Specification

## Overview
This specification defines the filtering and sorting functionality for the Todo application, allowing users to filter tasks by status and sort by creation or due date.

## Requirements Reference
Based on `docs/requirements/base.md` lines 30-32:
- ステータス別にタスクをフィルタリング (Filter tasks by status)
- 締切日で昇順／降順ソート (Sort by due date ascending/descending)

## Feature Details

### Filter Functionality
- **Filter by Status**: Users can filter tasks by their current status
  - All tasks (default view)
  - Pending tasks only
  - Completed tasks only
  - In-progress tasks (if applicable)

### Sort Functionality
- **Sort by Creation Date**:
  - Newest first (descending)
  - Oldest first (ascending)
- **Sort by Due Date**:
  - Earliest due date first (ascending)
  - Latest due date first (descending)
  - Tasks without due dates appear at the end

## User Interface Elements
- Filter dropdown/buttons for status selection
- Sort dropdown/buttons for date ordering
- Clear indication of current filter and sort settings
- Persistent settings across page refreshes

## Technical Considerations
- Filter and sort operations should be performed on the client side for responsive UX
- State management for current filter/sort preferences
- URL parameters to maintain filter/sort state on page refresh
- Efficient rendering for large task lists

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can filter tasks by status (all, pending, completed)
2. Users can sort tasks by creation date (newest/oldest first)
3. Users can sort tasks by due date (earliest/latest first)
4. Filter and sort settings persist across page refreshes
5. Clear visual indicators show current filter/sort state
6. Performance remains smooth with large task lists

## Edge Cases

### Empty Dataset Handling
- **No Tasks**: Display empty state message when no tasks exist
- **Filter Results in Empty List**: Show "No tasks match the current filter" message
- **All Tasks Completed**: Handle case where all tasks are in completed state
- **New User Experience**: Provide guidance when user has no tasks yet

### Data Boundaries
- **Single Task**: Ensure filtering and sorting work correctly with only one task  
- **Maximum Task Limit**: Handle performance gracefully up to 10,000 tasks
- **Mixed Due Dates**: Handle tasks with and without due dates in sort operations
- **Invalid Date Values**: Gracefully handle corrupted or invalid date data

## Performance Limits

### Client-Side Performance
- **Task Limit**: Optimize for up to 10,000 tasks without pagination
- **Filter Response Time**: Filter operations should complete within 100ms
- **Sort Response Time**: Sort operations should complete within 200ms
- **Memory Usage**: Maintain reasonable memory footprint for large datasets

### Fallback Strategies
- **Server-Side Pagination**: Implement when task count exceeds 10,000
- **Virtual Scrolling**: Consider for very long filtered lists
- **Progressive Loading**: Load and filter tasks in chunks if needed
- **Debounced Operations**: Prevent excessive filtering during rapid state changes

### Performance Monitoring
- **Metrics Collection**: Track filter/sort operation timing
- **User Experience**: Monitor for lag or unresponsiveness
- **Memory Leaks**: Ensure proper cleanup of filtered data structures
- **Browser Compatibility**: Test performance across different browsers

## Future Enhancements
- Multiple filter criteria (status + priority)
- Custom date range filtering
- Save filter/sort presets
- Advanced search with text filtering
