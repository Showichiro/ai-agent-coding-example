| M-02       | Are all fields and types justified by feature specs (not assumptions)? | **PASS**   | All fields in task.md trace back to feature requirements |
| M-03       | Are validation rules, enums, and relations clearly described?          | **PASS**   | Comprehensive validation rules, status enum, and constraints defined |
| M-04       | Are field names and types consistent with planned API schema?          | **PASS**   | Field names and types align with API specifications in features |

### üñºÔ∏è Section 4: UI

| Checkpoint | Description                                                              | Pass/Fail | Notes |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- | ----- |
| U-01       | Does every `ui/*.md` file reference the corresponding feature spec?      | **PASS**  | All UI components clearly reference their feature origins |
| U-02       | Are UI components described clearly (fields, buttons, interactions)?     | **PASS**   | Excellent detail in component descriptions, props, and interactions |
| U-03       | Are layout structure and user flow outlined (optionally via wireframes)? | **PASS**   | Comprehensive layouts with ASCII wireframes and responsive design |
| U-04       | Are only UI-specific details included (no backend logic)?                | **FAIL**  | task_form.md includes API endpoint details (POST /api/tasks) which should be in features/ |

### üìè Section 5: Workflow Consistency

| Checkpoint | Description                                                                                 | Pass/Fail | Notes |

## üìã Detailed Findings

### ‚úÖ Strengths
1. **Excellent Requirement Definition**: Base requirements clearly articulate user needs without prescriptive solutions
2. **Proper Feature Isolation**: Each feature is self-contained with clear boundaries and dependencies
3. **Comprehensive Model Design**: Task model is fully justified by feature requirements with robust validation
4. **Detailed UI Specifications**: Component designs include accessibility, responsiveness, and interaction patterns
5. **Strong Traceability**: Clear lineage from requirements through features to implementation designs

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Identified

#### Issue #1: API Details in UI Specification
- **File**: `docs/ui/task_form.md:24`
- **Problem**: Contains API endpoint specification (`POST /api/tasks`) which is implementation detail
- **Impact**: Minor violation of layer separation - UI specs should focus on user interaction, not backend contracts
- **Recommendation**: Move API details to feature specifications or create separate API documentation

---

### üéØ Recommendations

1. **Immediate Action Required**:
   - Remove API endpoint details from `task_form.md`
   - Consider creating dedicated API specification documentation

2. **Future Enhancements**:
   - Add user acceptance criteria to each feature for better testability
   - Consider adding sequence diagrams for complex interactions
   - Document error handling patterns more systematically

## üìä Compliance Score
**Overall Score**: 24/25 (96% compliance)
- Requirements: 3/3 ‚úÖ
- Features: 5/5 ‚úÖ  
- Models: 4/4 ‚úÖ
- UI: 3/4 ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Workflow: 4/4 ‚úÖ

## üìù Conclusion
The SimpleToDo project demonstrates exemplary design documentation practices with only one minor violation. The design artifacts provide a solid foundation for implementation with clear separation of concerns and comprehensive coverage of user needs.

**Recommendation**: **APPROVE** for implementation with minor correction to UI documentation.
